<span>111Audiance</span><span>: iOS developers - mid to senior level</span><br><span>What is the problem/pain:</span><br><span>Changes in code are fragile</span><br><strong>What do I want to share:</strong><br><span>Unit tests takes some time to set up and get use to</span><br><span>but when it works it saves time and prevents bugs</span><br><span>We need to be able to move fast</span></p>
<p>
<span>XXX</span><br><br></p>
<p>
<span>XXX</span></p>
<p>
<span>What we can’t do/won’t do:</span><br><span>We can not perform full ma regression testing on every feature</span></p>
<p>
<span>Unit tests should run fast and test a small part of logic</span></p>
<p>
<span>Meet our hero….</span><br><span>oh no…</span><br><span>conflict - changes are pain</span></p>
<p>
<span>what can he do?</span><br><span>X to the rescue</span></p>
<p>
<span>What did we achived - no more fear of changes</span></p>

<span>Thursday night, the phone rings someone asks for a small changes in the app</span><br><span>that should only take few minutes.</span><br><span>I do it….</span><br><span>release</span></p>
<p>
<span>and …. crisis</span></p>
<p>
<span>luckliy we have unit tests</span></p>
<p>
<span>in the end - i drank my cup of wine</span></p>
<h1>Apples and Butterflies</h1>
<p>
<span>Our story begin on Friday night.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Me and my wife got ready for a fun movie night, the pizza was hot and the wine was cold.</span></p>

<span>and then </span><strong>the phone rang</strong><span>.</span></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

> Hey Ido, we need this very very very small fix in the mobile app for like tomorrow morning.
> can you make it please, be our savior, the customer really really really need this fix…</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

> Well, ok I answered, I will do it right away.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<span>I sat down by the laptop, “This doesn’t sound too complicated”, I thought to myself.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
<span>The issue was done, quick sanity check and release, right?</span></p>
<p>
<strong>It was a very short article if it was right</strong></p>
<p>
<span>3 Hours later the phone rang again to find out that this very very very small fix caused a big issue in some area I would have never think it could effect, but it did.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If only there was some way to guard us from these kind of events?</span><br><span>There is…. and luckily this story is fictional, and in my daily routine I write and run Unit Tests & Automation Tests a lot.</span></p>
<p>
<span>For now lets focus on Unit Tests.</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
[09:35:14]: ▸ Test Succeeded
+--------------------+------+
|       Test Results        |
+--------------------+------+
| Number of tests    | 5794 |
| Number of failures | 0    |

<p>
<span>Yes, 5794 (at the time writing this article)</span></p>
<h2>Unit Tests, for a mobile app? Seriously, I can just test it manually in 5 minutes</h2>
<p>
<span>This might be true if the mobile app is small, but as the app gets bigger in code base and features a complete manual testing cycle can take several days.</span></p>
<p>
<span>It seems to me that unit tests for mobile app are not a consensus yet.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Assuming most of us already working on existing app or code base, the first challenge is adding unit tests for the first time.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Unit tests has some prerequisites that takes time to implement, but it doesn’t mean that the case should be </span><strong>all</strong><span> or </span><strong>none</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Some of the existing code might not built for testing, and changing it might be a little tricky.</span><br><span>The main pattern I use to allow components to be tested is </span><span>Dependency Injection</span><span>.</span></p>
<h2>But writing tests takes time</h2>
<p>
<span>Yes, it is true.</span><br><span>Writing tests takes time, sometimes it can even take longer than the time it took to write the code it is testing.</span><br><span>But it is a time well invested in the future of the code base.</span></p>
<h2>Unit Tests saves me money?</h2>
<p>
<span>We all know that time is money.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Every test we add will run in the future on every code change.</span><br><span>When an issue will be found by a unit test, it is caught in an early stage of the development, what usually makes it easier to fix.</span><br><span>Comparing issue found by unit tests to tracing an issue on an end-user after the app was released, or even compared to feedback from the QA team unit tests are much faster to trace and fix.</span></p>
<p>
<span>So unit tests saves time which also means they save money (developers / qa time has a cost).</span></p>
