                <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2021 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>

                <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
                <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
                <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>
                </blockquote>

We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
                <h3>Example lists</h3>
                <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First list item</li>
                    <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
                    <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First list item</li>
                    <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
                    <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
                </ol>
                <p>And this is a definition list:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</dt>
                    <dd>The language used to describe and define the content of a Web page</dd>

                <h2>Inline HTML elements</h2>
                <p>HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To bold text</strong>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</li>
                    <li><em>To italicize text</em>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;</code>.</li>
                    <pre><code class="language-swift highlighter-rouge">
                *hello*

struct Hello {
  func main() {

    let doub: Double = 543.54353

  }
}

                </code></pre>
                    <li>Abbreviations, like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, with an optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> attribute for the full phrase.</li>
                    <li>Citations, like <cite>— Mark Otto</cite>, should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;cite&gt;</code>.</li>
                    <li><del>Deleted</del> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;del&gt;</code> and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;ins&gt;</code>.</li>
                    <li>Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sup&gt;</code> and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sub&gt;</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.</p>

                    Our story begin on Friday night.</p>
                <p>
                    Me and my wife got ready for a fun movie night, the pizza was hot and the wine was cold.</p>

                I sat down by the laptop, “This doesn’t sound too complicated”, I thought to myself.</p>

                    The issue was done, quick sanity check and release, right?</p>

                <p class="fw-bold">It was a very short article if it was right</p>

                    3 Hours later the phone rang again to find out that this very very very small fix caused a big issue in some area I would have never think it could effect, but it did.</p>
                <p>
                    If only there was some way to guard us from these kind of events?<br>There is…. and luckily this story is fictional, and in my daily routine I write and run Unit Tests & Automation Tests a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    For now lets focus on Unit Tests.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-swift highlighter-rouge">

                Yes, 5794 (at the time writing this article)</p>
                <h2>Unit Tests, for a mobile app? Seriously, I can just test it manually in 5 minutes</h2>
                <p>
                    This might be true if the mobile app is small, but as the app gets bigger in code base and features a complete manual testing cycle can take several days.</p>
                <p>
                    It seems to me that unit tests for mobile app are not a consensus yet.</p>
                <p>
                    Assuming most of us already working on existing app or code base, the first challenge is adding unit tests for the first time.</p>
                <p>
                    Unit tests has some prerequisites that takes time to implement, but it doesn’t mean that the case should be <p class="fw-bold">all</p>
                or <p class="fw-bold">none</p>
                .</p>
                <p>
                    Some of the existing code might not built for testing, and changing it might be a little tricky.<br>The main pattern I use to allow components to be tested is Dependency Injection.</p>
                <h2>But writing tests takes time</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, it is true.<br>Writing tests takes time, sometimes it can even take longer than the time it took to write the code it is testing.<br>But it is a time well invested in the future of the code base.</p>
                <h2>Unit Tests saves me money?</h2>
                <p>
                    We all know that time is money.</p>
                <p>
                    Every test we add will run in the future on every code change.<br>When an issue will be found by a unit test, it is caught in an early stage of the development, what usually makes it easier to fix.<br>Comparing issue found by unit tests to tracing an issue on an end-user after the app was released, or even compared to feedback from the QA team unit tests are much faster to trace and fix.</p>
                <p>
                    So unit tests saves time which also means they save money (developers / qa time has a cost).</p>
