# Taking the right shortcuts

Oh Xcode, we love you, we hate you, and sometimes we just don't have much choice.

Given the fact that we spent most of our time using it, lets try to increase our productivity as much as possible.

The keyboard shortcuts I used most are Debugging related:

- Step Over - CMD + SHIFT + A 
- Step Into - CMD + SHIFT + S
- Step Out - CMD + SHIFT + D
- Pause / Continue - CMD + SHIFT + X

All debug related keys were select so they are clustered at the left side of the keyboard, making them easy to press.

And now I can debug without having to use my mouse.

Sounds like a small change, but I find help me a lot.
