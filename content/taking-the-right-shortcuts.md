After years of using Xcode, one day not too long ago I decided that from now on
I will only do debugging in Xcode using keyboard shortcuts, sorry dear mouse, it is
not personal but moving you around and clicking takes too much time.

The main keyboard shortcuts that were chosen are:

Step Over: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `A`

Step Into: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `S`

Step Out: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `D`

Pause / Continue: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `X`

The main decision I made about the key selection was that it will be easy to press when having to repeat using it over and over again.

After a successful pilot of debugging using keyboard shortcuts with Xcode, I defined that same keyboard shortcut in all IDEs that I use:

Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio. <br><br>

Very short after I started to use these keyboard shortcuts debugging has become more fun, or at least less pain.

#### Now that we learned that keyboard shortcuts are fun.

Lets review some more options.

Delete Line: `CMD` + `G`

Show file in project structure: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `R`

Open Quickly: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `O`

You don't have the make the same keyboard shortcut selections that I did, but just try to notice
how you keyboard vs. mouse interrupts your workflow, but you can improve it by using the mouse a little less.
